The apps built for and used by the governments are mostly massive, complicated and expensive structures. Every time I thought about it, it seemed these systems are not done right. It had to be smaller, simpler, less expensive and more efficient. It just happened that I had an opportunity to test if my thinking was correct or not.

Had to built a learning management system - a website where people can come and learn specific topics, government staff can create / edit the learning materials, track user progress, overall user statistics, etc. All this could have been done using already available, over-time well tested applications like moodle. But again, these systems are **giant monoliths, not graceful and efficient structures of microservices**.

In the end, I think I proven my point. These systems can be built to be small and efficient. Not that it has a super-massive user base (~200-350 unique visitors a day, up to 10k requests a day), but it runs very smoothly on two small cloud VM's (f1-micro) and a free tier mongodb instance. While building this, had to put a lot of thought into db structure / models and how to keep the compute load on the client side and not push it over to the server side. Whilest building this I definitely learned a lot and proved that monolith giants are a thing of the past (even for the governments)..?
