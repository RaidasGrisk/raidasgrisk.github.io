The apps built for and used by the governments are mostly massive, complicated and expensive structures. Every time I thought about it, it seemed these systems are not done right. It had to be smaller, simpler, less expensive and more efficient. It just happened that I had an opportunity to battle-test if my thinking was correct.

I had to built a learning management system - a website where people can come and learn specific topics, site administrators can create / edit the learning materials, track user progress, overall user statistics, etc. All this could have been done using already available, over-time well tested applications like moodle. But again, these systems are **giant monoliths, not graceful and efficient structures of microservices**. So I settled to build my own tiny and efficient version of it.

In the end, I think I proven my point. These systems can be built to be small and efficient. Despite not having a massive user base (averaging around 250-400 unique visitors and up to 10k requests per day), my system runs smoothly on just two small cloud VMs and a free tier MongoDB instance. I focused on optimizing the database structure and models, as well as minimizing the compute load on the server side. This approach allowed me to keep the system running smoothly while keeping costs low. Whilest building this I definitely learned a lot and proved that monolith giants can be a thing of the past (even for the governments)..?
