I worked at a company (just 2 people) that primarily handled government projects. We did not have time to consistently monitor government procurement activities for opportunities that aligned with our interests. I wanted to automate this by developing a web scraper that could automatically monitor all government tenders, analyze them based on pre-defined criteria, and notify us of potential opportunities.

I soon realized that our solution required a front-end interface. I initially experimented with Python's Django framework but did not like it, and eventually settled on exploring vue.js. I also explored different hosting options, such as AWS and Google Cloud, and after a few iterations and modifications, I managed to create my first fully-fledged web application that included a front-end, back-end, and database.

In the end, through experimenting and prototyping various solutions I've got some basic understanding of how traditional web apps work and how different parts of the web app interact with each other. A much better way to learn all this would be to properly study it, but isn't it boring compared to rapid experimentation and fast prototyping?
