I worked at a company (just 2 people) that mostly dealt with government projects. We did not have time to routinely check if the government is procuring something of interest to us. I wanted to automate the process and alert us once specific government procurements are announced. So to do that, I've built a web scraper that scrapes all the gov tenders into our db, searches through them based on some rules, and alerts us to take action.

At this time I realized, that we need a front-end. This led to exploring vue.js (at first I tried python's django, but really did not like it), and hosting opportunities (AWS and Google Cloud). After a couple of changes and tweaks, this led to building my first fully-fledged (front-end, back-end, and database) web application.

In the end, through experimenting and prototyping various solutions I've got some basic understanding of how traditional web apps work and how different parts of the web app interact with each other. A much better way to learn all this would be to properly study it, but isn't it boring compared to rapid experimentation and fast prototyping?
