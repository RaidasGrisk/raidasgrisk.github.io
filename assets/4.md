I was curious about computer vision models that are capable of doing predictions real-time. Real-time computer vision applications always look so advanced and sofisticated üßë‚Äçüíª. So I wanted to build one myself.

### Text recognition

I started with [**simple text recognition model**](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/tf2-crnn) that combines CNNs and RNNs to convert image (containing text) -> text. Once I got this sorted out, I continued with a [**bigger model**](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/tf2-fots) that:
1. detect regions of text (also the angle of text in the region!)
2. extract these regions and rotate them so the text is roughly horizontal
3. finally feed it into a text recognition branch of the model to output the actual text

This model had a quite unique architecture (I did not come up with it! [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01671)) that was novel. Instead of combining different models that perform different tasks, this model did all tasks with a single end-to-end pass (single forward pass). ![image from the original paper](https://i.imgur.com/krHzhvr.jpg)

I remember the struggles to train it (did not have a big enough GPU ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Ended up using a smaller model with less parameters. Anyway, tweaking and redoing this model over and over again (until it produced something) was hard, but in the end was totally worth it.

### Face recognition

Another project I worked on was a [model to detect human faces and compare it with pre-existing images to infer identity](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/tf2-face-detection-recognition). This was a much simpler model (actually two models: one to detect, another one to compare with pre-determined faces), but again, building it helped me learn some of the concepts better (e.g. triplet loss, vector similarity). The end result is looks nice, so here's a gif ü§ó ![](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/tf2-face-detection-recognition/blob/master/data/other/gif.gif?raw=true)
