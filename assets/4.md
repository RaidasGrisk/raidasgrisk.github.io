I was curious about computer vision models that are capable of doing predictions in real time. Real-time computer vision applications always look so advanced and sophisticated üßë‚Äçüíª, so I wanted to build one myself.

### Text recognition

I started with a [**basic text recognition model**](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/tf2-crnn) that utilized CNNs and RNNs to convert images containing text into actual text. Once I had this working, I moved on to a sligtly more [**complex model**](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/tf2-fots) that: 
1. detected regions of text, also determined their angles, 
2. extracted them, and rotated them to be roughly horizontal 
3. fed them into the text recognition branch of the model. 

This model had a unique architecture that allowed all tasks to be performed with a single end-to-end pass, rather than combining different models for different tasks (I did not come up with it! [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01671)). ![image from the original paper](https://i.imgur.com/krHzhvr.jpg)

Training the model was difficult due to a lack of sufficient GPU power ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I ended up using a smaller model with fewer parameters. Anyway, tweaking and redoing this model over and over again (until it produced something) was hard, but in the end, was totally worth it.

### Face recognition

I continued my learning by building a [face recognition model that detected human faces and compared them to pre-existing images to infer identity](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/tf2-face-detection-recognition). Although this model was simpler (actually two models: one to detect, another one to compare with pre-determined faces), it still helped me refresh my understanding of important concepts such as triplet loss and vector similarity. The end result looks nice, so here's a gif ü§ó ![](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/tf2-face-detection-recognition/blob/master/data/other/gif.gif?raw=true)
