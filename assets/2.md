Having learned the basics of machine learning, I had to make a proper practical use of it. At the time, I was intrigued by the idea of automated trading/investing, it seemed like the most amazing thing in the world - having continuously learning and back-tested algorithms do all the work, make profits while I sit and watch..? Sadly never made it to that point 😁. But this was my first attempt at structuring and building a small yet fully functional program. While doing this, I've created my first class, tried to figure out how to make different parts of the program to interact with one another. Generally, went through an experience of trying to build a tiny program having very little theory of how it's supposed to be done and instead just experimenting.

To this date this project is my most starred repository on github (got nearly **100** stars) 😁. It's a shame because as of now it looks like quite poorly structured and outdated 🤷‍♂️.
