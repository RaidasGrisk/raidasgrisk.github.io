After mastering the fundamentals of machine learning, I sought to apply my knowledge practically. At the time, I became fascinated with the concept of automated trading and investing, envisioning continuously learning and back-tested algorithms generating profits while I passively observed. Unfortunately, I never quite reached that point 😁. However, this endeavor marked my initial foray into building a small yet fully functional program. Along the way, I created my first class and grappled with how to effectively integrate various program components. Despite having limited theoretical understanding and lack of practical experience, I persevered by experimenting with different approaches.

To this day, this project remains my most popular repository on GitHub, with nearly **100** stars 🔥. However, I must admit that its current structure is somewhat outdated and poorly organized 🤷‍.
