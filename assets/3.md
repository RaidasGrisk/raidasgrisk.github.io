My job was to build fraud/scam detection models (basically, keep fighting new fraud tactics and try to keep the damage inflicted as low as possible). The first thing that struck me as a newbie, was how real-world data is such a mess, full of guesses and unknowns ([a classic in the field](https://external-preview.redd.it/gEOa_rk0tKWUdzrbu7CylfvbJ3wRVTwkT1BjbPfu7UY.jpg?auto=webp&s=0e4addf4322bbfe243cb4a46faaa21f373b37929) üòÅ). I was given quite a lot of freedom and with some guidance, my plan was to:

1. **Define the metrics and make dashboards to keep track of all the KPIs** (including model performance over time).
2. **Build the fraud/scam detection models.** Whilst building what has been tested and working well so far (random forests and logistic regressions), try out some new approaches like variational autoencoders, a bundle of multiple models that vote, a model that retrains itself regularly. Also improved on feature creation and selection algorithms (pull and create as many features as possible, run algorithms to pick the most useful).
3. **Patch the models by introducing hand-crafted rules.** I'm proud I was able to easily automate this by creating a custom random forest model that outputs simple rule suggestions (tree nodes) that would patch the holes and stop freshly emerging fraud/scam patterns.

Enjoyed being around (and learning from) people who knew what they were doing. Loved the freedom to experiment and try out new ideas. Also learned a bunch about how banks continuously fight fraud/scam and how to write better code. **Was selected as a *Q2 WU Way Star winner* üèÜ** (basically an [employee of the month](https://youtu.be/BFs2DNJavio?t=68)).
