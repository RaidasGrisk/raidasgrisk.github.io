I was on the lookout for something fresh and thrilling to dive into. Lucky for me, I hopped on board with the Mina community, and I started exploring and tinkering around with the Mina blockchain's mind-bending zero-knowledge powered smart contracts. Back then, this tech was totally alien to me, and grasping the ins and outs of zero-knowledge and how it all actually worked was a bit of a brain-teaser. But I caught onto the basics pretty swiftly.

Let's break down Mina and snarkyJS into plain talk:

1. **💻 Smart contracts are executed on the client side.** Unlike on Ethereum, where you input the contract address, method, and data, and then a bunch of validators do their thing on the "server side" to agree on what went down, Mina takes a different route. The smart contract code gets executed on client side, and both the proof and state change are sent as part of the transaction. Validators then make sure everything checks out. The smart contracts aren't even stored on-chain; only their verification key gets stored. This allow smart contracts to get computationally expensive without making your transaction fees skyrocket. Plus, it sneaks in some privacy magic – the smart contract inputs stay put on your side and never venture off your device. I know, this is truly magical 👀 this is what zero knowledge proofs are all about.

2. **🔮 zkOracles allows to quickly bring outside data.** zkOracle is basically a simple web API that responds with data and a special signature. You use it to make sure the outside data inputted into a smart contract is the real deal, no funny business. zkOracle is to Mina as Chainlink is to Ethereum, but better and more elegant (if we ignore trust issues). You deploy your own zkOracle that is designed for your own use, no need for Chainlink-like-solutions. It is really handy way to pull in off-chain data for your smart contracts, all while keeping everything super-simple and in check.

3. **🪶 tiny blockchain, just 22 KB.** All the stuff just mentioned (and a bit of extra enchantment that I'm yet to fully understand) gives the Mina blockchain tiny size. But I think it's kind of a marketing stunt more than anything super crucial (the archive nodes are still used as the main source of data).

#### Some of the things I've built and worked on:

1. **📜 Basic zero-knowledge programs**. [zk explanation](https://zkapp-ui.vercel.app/) (I was even handpicked as one of the splendid seven winners in the Mina zkApps beta testers squad 🏆). Created [zk-app](http://zk-mina-github.vercel.app/) where you can prove that a Mina account belongs to a GitHub user.

2. **[🛰️ Built Mina node dashboard](https://mina-node-dashboard.vercel.app/)**. Really enjoyed the process of learning more about the Mina protocol and trying out GraphQL for the first time. GraphQL is very intuitive, handy and fast to work with. Also brushed my Vuejs and SQL skills.

3. **👷‍♂️ Community work**. Reviewed some of the documentation and tutorials on snarkyJS. Participated as an elector and mentor on zkIgnite (the turbocharge-your-Mina-projects pre-accelerator). Generally, it's been a blast to work within a very open and efficient community. Also learned a ton!
