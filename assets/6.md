I had lots of motivation to expand my knowledge of APIs and how websites work. As a result, I pursued any ideas that piqued my interest.

One of these ideas led me to create nameSpy, an API that could determine a person's level of online fame. For instance, Bart Simpson would receive a score of `0.95665`, while Evan You's score would be `0.4668`. The API functioned as follows:

1. **Check multiple sources like Google, Wikipedia, Twitter, and Instagram for data associated with a given name.**
2. **Extract relevant data, analyze it, and generate a score based on the average population.**

In addition, I developed another API that could identify the profession most likely to be associated with a given name. This involved a combination of data scraping, language translation, and machine learning for entity detection.

Despite the potential of the project, my interest gradually waned and the initiative fizzled out. Nonetheless, I gained valuable experience in new concepts such as API-gateway, logging, docker, and serverless architecture, and honed my coding skills. In the process, I found out that:

1. scraping Linkedin's data is nearly impossible
2. but you can trick google and use their google-translate services unlimited for free
3. the only way to reliably scrape google and Instagram data is to use proxies
4. there are no free proxies, and most TOR exit nodes are blocked by Google
5. Twitter has an open and free API, the other giants are no longer as open (e.g. FB/IG).
