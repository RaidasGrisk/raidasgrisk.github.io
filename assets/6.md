I had lots of motivation to further learn how APIs and websites work but did not know what to do with it. So whenever I got any ideas, I would just dive into it.

One such idea was nameSpy, an API that would tell how famous a person is on the internets. For example, Bart Simpson has a score of `0.95665`, while Evan You's score is `0.4668`. The API did the following:
1. **Check google, wikipedia, twitter and instagram for data asociated with a name.**
2. **Pull relevant data, process it and output a score (based on average population).**

I also implemented another api that output a profession that is most likely associated with a name provided (a combination of data scraping, language translation and machine learning for entity detection). But the whole project slowly died out and I lost interest. Besides learning new concepts (api-gateway, logging, docker, serverless architecture, ...) and practicing writing code, I found out that:

1. scraping linkedin's data is nearly impossible
2. but you can trick google and use their google-translate services unlimited for free
3. the only way to reliably scrape google and instagram data is to use proxies
4. there are no proper free proxies (and most of TOR exit nodes are blocked by google)
5. twitter has an open and free api, the other giants are no longer as open (e.g. fb/insta).

The API's are no longer functioning (although it would with a bit of fixing), but the site is still there üòÅ **https://www.namespy.dev/**
