#### **Blockchain space is exciting because:**
1. increase of efficiency of storing public data, i.e. DIDs, SBTs etc.
2. zero knowledge proofs (the tools to offload compute to the client side)
3. smart contracts sitting on chain are awesome and super interesting
4. relentless innovation

#### **So far I've:**
