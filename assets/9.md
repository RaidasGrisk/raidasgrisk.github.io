### **I like working with crypto and blockchain because:**
1. the potential of increase of efficiency of storing public data in better ways, i.e. DIDs, SBTs etc.
2. smart contracts sitting on chain are awesome and super interesting
3. zero knowledge proofs (the tools to offload compute to the client side)
4. alternative social structures and incentive mechanisms, i.e. DAOs etc.
5. the community is relentless in terms of innovation and the devs are really working hard to push it forward

### **So far I've:**
