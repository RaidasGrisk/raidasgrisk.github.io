### **I like working with crypto and blockchain because:**
1. the potential of increase of efficiency of storing public data in better ways, i.e. DIDs, SBTs etc.
2. smart contracts sitting on chain are awesome and super interesting
3. zero knowledge proofs (the tools to offload compute to the client side)
4. alternative social structures and incentive mechanisms, i.e. DAOs etc.
5. the community is relentless in terms of innovation and the devs are really working hard to push it forward

### **So far I've:**
1. delved into basic concepts like consensus mechanisms, scalability dilemmas, hashing, etc.
2. moved through Gary Gensler's MIT course on [Blockchain and money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn).
3. got some basics of solidity and smart contracts on [cryptozombies.io](https://cryptozombies.io/)
4. went through main courses on [learnweb3.io](https://learnweb3.io/). Check out nft-certs [1, 2, 3, 4]
5. explored the difference between [web2 and web3 app backends](https://web2vsweb3-snowy.vercel.app/) from the dev perspective
6. done some zk-app building on Mina protocol (snarkyjs) and made a [basic zero knowledge proof explanation](https://zkapp-ui.vercel.app/). With it, was selected as one of the 7 winners of Mina zkApps beta testers program üèÜ!
