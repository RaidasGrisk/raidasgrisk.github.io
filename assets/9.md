#### **Blockchain space is exciting because:**
1. increase of efficiency of storing public data, i.e. DIDs, SBTs etc.
2. zero knowledge proofs (tools to offload compute to the client side and keep data private)
3. smart contracts sitting on chain are awesome and super interesting
4. relentless innovation

#### **Things I've done:**

1. **Studied the basics üß±**: 
   * Delved into core concepts like consensus mechanisms, scalability dilemmas, hashing, byzantine generals problem, etc., 
   * Studied Gary Gensler's MIT course on [Blockchain and money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn), Patric's [32 hour length course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ), main courses on [learnweb3.io](https://learnweb3.io/). 
   * Run an [ethereum node](https://prater.beaconcha.in/validator/aa679b04b4d69a685a05fb4359bb4c4a8c6ec67114de3274ca80811124a251eeb0bbdb55e9272afa153050a9941e6122#deposits) on prater network using Rocketpool on a RaspberryPi 4.

2. **Web2 vs Web3 ‚öîÔ∏è**. Explored the difference between [web2 and web3 app backends](https://web2vsweb3-snowy.vercel.app/) from the dev perspective.

3. **Build zero-knowledge programs üìú**. Done zk-app building on Mina protocol (snarkyjs) and made a [basic zk explanation](https://zkapp-ui.vercel.app/) (was selected as one of the 7 winners of Mina zkApps beta testers program üèÜ). Created [zk-app](http://zk-mina-github.vercel.app/) that allows prooving that Mina account is held by a Gihub user (likely will improving the app and expanding it's logic further).

5. **[Built (still building) Mina node dashboard](https://mina-node-dashboard.vercel.app/)**. Really enjoyed the process of learning more about mina protocol and trying out GraphQL for the first time. Also brushed my vuejs skills.
