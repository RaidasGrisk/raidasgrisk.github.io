#### **Blockchain space is exciting because:**
1. increase of efficiency of storing public data, i.e. DIDs, SBTs, etc.
2. zero-knowledge proofs (tools to offload computing to the client side and keep data private)
3. smart contracts sitting on chain are awesome and super interesting
4. relentless innovation

#### **Things I've done:**

1. **Studied the basics üß±**: 
   * Delved into core concepts like consensus mechanisms, scalability dilemmas, hashing, byzantine generals problem, etc., 
   * Studied Gary Gensler's MIT course on [Blockchain and money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63UUkfL0onkxF6MYgVa04Fn), Patric's [32-hour length course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ), and main courses on [learnweb3.io](https://learnweb3.io/). 
   * Run an [Ethereum node](https://prater.beaconcha.in/validator/aa679b04b4d69a685a05fb4359bb4c4a8c6ec67114de3274ca80811124a251eeb0bbdb55e9272afa153050a9941e6122#deposits) on Prater network using Rocketpool on a Raspberry Pi 4.

2. **Web2 vs Web3 ‚öîÔ∏è**. Explored the difference between [web2 and web3 app backends](https://web2vsweb3-snowy.vercel.app/) from the dev perspective.

3. **Build zero-knowledge programs üìú**. Done zk-app building on Mina protocol (snarkyjs) and made a [basic zk explanation](https://zkapp-ui.vercel.app/) (was selected as one of the 7 winners of Mina zkApps beta testers program üèÜ). Created [zk-app](http://zk-mina-github.vercel.app/) that allows proving that a Mina account is held by a Gihub user.

5. **[Built Mina node dashboard](https://mina-node-dashboard.vercel.app/)**. Really enjoyed the process of learning more about the mina protocol and trying out GraphQL for the first time. Also brushed my vuejs / SQL skills.
