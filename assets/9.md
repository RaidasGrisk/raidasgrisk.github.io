**I am captured by blockchain tech because:**
1. the potential of increase of efficiency of storing public data in better ways, i.e. DIDs etc.
2. smart contracts sitting on chain seems awesome
3. zero knowledge proofs are so interesting (cannot wait until we have the tools to offload compute to the client side and store the proof of it on the chain)
4. potentially new social structures and well structured incentive mechanisms, i.e. DAOs etc.
5. the community is relentless in terms of innovation and the devs are really working hard to push it forward

**So far I've:**
1. Delved into basic concepts like consensus mechanisms, scalability dilemmas, hashing, etc.
2. Slowly moved through Gary Gensler's MIT course on Blockchain and money.
3. Written basic solidity code with the help of cryptozombies.io
4. Went through basic knowledge on learnweb3.io. Also received their nft-certificates [1, 2, 3, 4].
5. Explored the difference between how [web2 app differs from web3 app](https://web2vsweb3-snowy.vercel.app/) from the dev perspective.
6. Done some zk-app building with the help of Mina protocol challenges (snarkyjs).
