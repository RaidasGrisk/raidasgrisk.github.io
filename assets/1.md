I began a pursuit to learn machine learning and programming fundamentals. After some exploration, I enrolled in [Andrew NG's legendary machine learning course](https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-sunsets-machine-learning/), opting to use Python rather than the original Octave implementation (what a visionary choice, I know üòÅ). From there, I delved into a variety of topics, including reinforcement learning [[1](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/ML-algorithms/blob/master/Policy_gradient_breakout.py), [2](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/ML-algorithms/blob/master/DQN_Breakout.py)], convolutional neural networks [[1](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/ML-algorithms/blob/master/CNN.py)], and recurrent neural networks [[1](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/ML-algorithms/blob/master/RNN_predict_next_char.py)], all while implementing my own solutions using [low-level libraries](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPmEIuvWAAAelAG?format=jpg&name=small) like numpy instead of more specialized tools like TensorFlow. Additionally, I completed the [CS50](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/cs50-harward) course to bolster my computer science skills. 

My ultimate goal was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the field, and I'm proud to say that I accomplished just that, developing a strong theoretical foundation and solid programming skills in the process. It was completely worthwhile, as **having a solid foundation provides significantly more capability and potential**.
