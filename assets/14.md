When light is shone into a liquid, as it passes through, some of it is captured by various materials and molecules within the liquid. For instance, if you shine light into a liquid containing fat molecules, some of the light at wavelengths around ~2310 will be absorbed. The chart below illustrates the light absorption of cow milk, showing that some of the light in that range is indeed absorbed by the fat molecules in the milk!

But is it only fat molecules that we can detect, or are there more patterns that we can we possibly detect to for example check whether a cow is sick, pregnant, or perhaps having a good or bad day? It appears that all of this and more is feasible; we just need to cleverly employ machine learning tools to teach models to predict these variables. It seems like a perfect place for serious data processing, feeding it to RNNs/LSTMs to learn and predict various labels.

Some aspects that I am still wrapping my head around:

1. **The sheer number of moving parts and complexity in the hardware required to make this work.** It begins with growing your own crystal with specific atom arrangements, then using it to manufacture a laser chip. This chip is later embedded into a small device along with light source and lenses to direct the light, a couple of tubes for the liquid to flow through, and a computer processing chip to collected and aggregate the data (around 100 laser light reads per second). By then, you might have a working hardware, but cow habitats are not laboratory-like environments, so there's a need for constant monitoring and fixing of the devices. Not to mention how to deal with the gravitational force that might affect the path of the traveling light ðŸ¤¯.

2. **The potential of this technology to help us with our health.** Who knows, if we can make it work with animals, maybe one day we can implant a minuscule laser chip under our skin and shine it into our blood to gather real-time health data? We could employ machine learning models to interpret this data. For example, every morning, provide us with a health overview, including risks, possible diseases, nutrition deficiencies, etc. Alert us if any health anomalies are detected. Before delving into that, there are giant walls of GDPR and other regulations that, fortunately, don't apply to cows who are more than happy for us to help them with our insigts.
