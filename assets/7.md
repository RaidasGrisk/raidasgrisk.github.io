In February 2021, during the meme stock frenzy surrounding GameStop and AMC, I aimed to test a hypothesis: can the hype generated on the internet predict future prices? However, measuring the level of internet hype was not a simple task. To overcome this, I developed an application that parses all user interactions on Reddit's [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) subreddit, scanning for the frequency of mentions of various coins. Having all this data, I exposed it via API, made a very simple front-end, and also a Reddit bot that keeps the r/cc community informed of what's popular right now.

I encountered the challenge of efficiently processing small computational tasks for each comment in a busy comment stream. To effectively capture all user comments in a subreddit, I needed to ensure that the process was optimized for a small machine with limited computing power. During periods of high activity, the subreddit generates around 15 comments per second, which must be ingested, scanned for coin mentions, and then pushed to a database. As of now, the database contains more than 15 million comments, which I'm keeping for future research purposes üòÅ.

Surprisingly the app has gained some [popularity](https://redditcoins.app/report.html), attracting over 100,000 unique visitors thus far (with approximately 100-250 daily visitors).

The front end could use some improvements, be upgraded and refreshed, but here goes:
