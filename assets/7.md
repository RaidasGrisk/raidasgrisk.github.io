In February 2021, amidst the meme stock frenzy surrounding GameStop and AMC, I embarked on a mission to test a hypothesis: can internet hype predict future prices? However, gauging the level of online hype posed a daunting challenge. To overcome this, I developed an application that parses all user interactions on Reddit's [r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) subreddit and scans for the frequency of mentions of various crypto coins. Armed with this data, I exposed it through an API, developed a simple front-end, and created a Reddit bot that keeps the r/cc community abreast of the latest trends.

One of the biggest obstacles I faced was efficiently processing small computational tasks for each comment in a busy comment stream. To ensure that the system could handle capturing every single comment in a subreddit, I needed to optimize it for a small machine with limited computing power. During peak activity, the subreddit generates up to 15 comments per second, all of which must be ingested, scanned for coin mentions, and then pushed to a database. Currently, the database contains over 15 million comments, which I'm preserving for future research endeavors üòÅ.

Remarkably, the app has gained [traction](https://redditcoins.app/report.html) and drawn more than 100,000 unique visitors so far, with roughly 100-250 daily visitors.

While the front-end could use some improvements, but here goes:
