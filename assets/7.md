Remember the meme stock frenzy in feb 2021 (gamestop, amc, etc.)? I wanted to test the hypotheses if the internet hype has any predicting power on future prices. The internet hype was not easy to measure. I ended up creating an app that parses all the user interactions on reddit's subreddit and scans it for the number of times various coins are mentioned. Having all this data, I exposed it via API, made a very simple front-end and also reddit bot that keeps the r/cc community informed of what's popular right now.

Somehow, the app became [popular](https://redditcoins.app/report.html) (at least by my standards 😁) and so far attracted over 85k unique visitors (~100-250 per day).

The unique thing about this app for me was that it had to have efficient code. Capturing all the user comments of such a big subreddit must be very fast and asynchronous process (having in mind that I want it to run on small machine with limited compute power). At the peak activity, the subreddit produces ~15 comments a second. The app has to ingest all of this, push it to db and scan for coin mentions. Currently the db stores over 15 million comments (keeping it for future research 😁).

The front end could use some improvements, be upgraded and refreshed, but here goes:
