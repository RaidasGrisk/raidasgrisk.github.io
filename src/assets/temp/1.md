Set about to learn machine learning and basics of programming. After wondering around for a bit, took the legendary Andrew NG's course (at the time the course was based on [Octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave), instead I decided to do it all in python; what a visionary choice, I know üòÅ). Did some reinforcement learning [[1](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/ML-algorithms/blob/master/Policy_gradient_breakout.py), [2](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/ML-algorithms/blob/master/DQN_Breakout.py)], CNNs [[1](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/ML-algorithms/blob/master/CNN.py)], RNNs [[1](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/ML-algorithms/blob/master/RNN_predict_next_char.py)], you name it. The goal was to implement things by myself using [lower level libraries](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPmEIuvWAAAelAG?format=jpg&name=small) (i.e. numpy instead of tensorflow). Also took [CS50](https://github.com/RaidasGrisk/cs50-harward) to gain some CS skills. Basically wanted to learn and understand everything there was. Ended up having pretty good basics and firm theoretical understanding of the whole field.

The learning period was intense, but it was totally worth it because having firm basics gives you so much more power. I am still proud of the beginner code written back then and can proudly share and walk through it.
