My job was to build fraud/scam detection models (basically, keep fighting new fraud tactics and try to keep the losses as low as possible). The first thing that struck me as a newbie, was how real-world data is such a mess, full of guesses and unknowns ([a classic in the field](https://innotescus.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/normal-300x256.jpg) üòÅ). I was given quite a lot of freedom so I here was my plan:

1. **Define your metrics and make dashboards to keep track of all this** (including model performance over time).
2. **Build the fraud/scam detection models.** Try out some new stuff, random forests and logistic regressions work well, but how about variational auto encoders, a bundle of multiple models that vote, a model that retrains itself regularly, etc.? Pull and create as much features as possible, run algorithms to pick the most useful.
3. **Patch the models by introducing hand-crafted rules.** I'm proud I was able to easily automate this by creating a custom random forest model that outputs simple rule suggestions (tree nodes) that would stop most fraud/scam.

Enjoyed being around (and learning from) people who new what they're doing. Loved the freedom to experiment and try out weird ideas. Also learned a bunch about how banks fight fraud/scam and how to write better code. Was selected as a *Q2 WU Way Star winner* üèÜ ([employee of the month](https://youtu.be/BFs2DNJavio?t=68), haha).
